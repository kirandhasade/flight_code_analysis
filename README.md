### Project Name: Flight Prediction Analysis

### Project Objective:
- The number of people who fly has dramatically increased in recent years. Pricing alters dynamically owing to many variables, making it difficult for airlines to maintain prices. As a result, we will attempt to solve this problem by cleaning, preparing and analysing the flight price.
- Hence, the goal of this project is to clean, prepare and analyse the flight price dataset taken from Kaggle.
- Basically dataset have price based on information such as airline, date_of_journey, flight route information including number of stops and duration of flight.
- So that we can use this dataset to analyse the flight journey price based on a variety of variables as mentioned above. 

Using flight price dataset we try to find out following questions answer:
1. Top 10 Aviation Companies whose flight tickets are sold the most ?
2. Which month have most number of flights?
3. Which airline is most expensive?
4. Which airline has boarded the most?
5. Which source will be having highest fare?
6. Which destination will be having highest fare?

### Analysis Involve Phases:
1. Data collection
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation 
4. Data Analyse
